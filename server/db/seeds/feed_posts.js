A for loop is like counting the steps ‚Äì you know exactly how many you need. An while loop is more like wandering around until you see a familiar tree. Either way, keep your wits about you and don't get lost. And remember, always have a good reason to get out of that loop ‚Äì otherwise, you'll be stuck in the muck forever!`,
